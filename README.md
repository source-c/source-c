### ðŸ‘‹ A little bit about me:

- ðŸ’¬ Mentor
- ðŸŒ± Business Developer
- ðŸ‘¯ IT Business Partner
- âš¡ Distributed Systems Expert 
- ðŸ”­ Practical Software Architect
- âœ¨ Seasoned Chief Engineer and (occasionally) Software Developer

### ... and some spices

- I am an apologist of a real AI and SONs, distributed systems and crypto and of course I am always open to new challenges where my empirical experience and the years of practice are applicable and efficient
- I have no YT/FB/IG or any other hyped and enterprise oriented media stuff, instead I prefer open platforms and real-life activities
- I may periodically conduct closed consultative sessions and seminars on topics that are impressing me
- I am always ready to learn something new, do academic studies, and have a thought that learning is a continuous process and an inalienable part of our life
- I believe that our personal time is our most expensive treasure, is a most valuable asset we have, and at the same time it is a precious and non-renewable to waste it on nonsense

ðŸ“« How to reach me: 

- follow me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ai-pro/), or in case you wanna contact me directly - try to write me an PM/InMail there
- subscribe to me on [Substack](https://canny.substack.com/)

Everything else is unreliable, slow and has a low priority for me.
