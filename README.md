- âš¡ Distributed Systems Expert

- âœ¨ Seasoned Chief Engineer and occasionally Software Developer

### ... and the spices to the soup

- I personally interested in real AI and SONs, distributed systems and crypto and of course I am always open to new challenges where my empirical experience of the long years practice might be applicable and efficient :)
- I'm not doing hype things in YT/FB/IG, have no public/blogger activities and definitely not going to do it in future
- I periodically conduct closed consultative sessions and seminars on topics that are close to me and in which I have sufficient experience
- I am always ready to learn something new
- I believe that our personal time is our most expensive treasure
